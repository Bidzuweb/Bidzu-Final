# Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## 🚨 Problem Fixed

The main issue was that your Next.js pages were using `revalidate: 0` which forces build-time data fetching from your backend server. Since your backend at `http://195.26.254.100:7777` isn't accessible during Vercel's build process, this caused the deployment to fail.

## ✅ What I Fixed

I've updated the following pages to use dynamic rendering instead of static generation:

1. **Home page** (`src/app/[lang]/page.tsx`)
2. **Auctions list** (`src/app/[lang]/auctions/page.tsx`)
3. **Starting soon auctions** (`src/app/[lang]/auctions/starting-soon/page.tsx`)
4. **Promoted auctions** (`src/app/[lang]/auctions/promoted/page.tsx`)
5. **Auctions map** (`src/app/[lang]/auctions/map/page.tsx`)
6. **Last seen auctions** (`src/app/[lang]/auctions/last-seen/page.tsx`)
7. **Recommendations** (`src/app/[lang]/auctions/recommendations/page.tsx`)

### **Changes Made:**
- Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to each page
- Removed all `next: { revalidate: 0 }` options
- Fixed error message logging

## 🔧 How to Deploy

### **Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Vercel**
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings → Environment Variables**
3. Add these variables:

```env
# Backend Server Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=http://195.26.254.100:7777
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_WS_URL=ws://195.26.254.100:7777
APP_URL=https://www.bidzuu.com

# Add your other environment variables...
```

### **Step 2: Deploy**
1. Commit and push your changes to your repository
2. Vercel will automatically trigger a new deployment
3. The build should now complete successfully

## 🎯 How It Works Now

- **Build Time**: No API calls are made, pages are not rendered statically
- **Runtime**: When users visit pages, data is fetched from your backend server
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Each page renders fresh content on each request
- **No Build Errors**: Vercel can complete the build without backend dependencies

## 🔍 Verification

After deployment, verify that:
1. ✅ Build completes successfully on Vercel
2. ✅ Homepage loads without errors
3. ✅ Auction pages display data from your backend
4. ✅ No console errors about failed API calls

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Deploy**: Try deploying again with these fixes
2. **Test**: Verify all pages work correctly
3. **Monitor**: Check that data loads from your backend
4. **Optimize**: Consider adding caching strategies later

Your deployment should now work successfully!
